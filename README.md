# Heart-Disease-Predictor

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle to predict the likeliness of heart disease within a patient using Python, Pandas, and Tesnorflow. I intially went to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM), however after experimenting with other algorithms, I ended up using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which yielded better results, more efficiently. The final notebook is in the repository. The checkpoints file and dataset are also uploaded in the repository. Thank you!
