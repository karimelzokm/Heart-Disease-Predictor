# Heart-Disease-Predictor

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle to predict the likeliness of heart disease within a patient using Python, Pandas, and Tesnorflow. I intially went to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM), however after experimenting with other algorithms, I ended up using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which yielded better results, more efficiently. The final test accuracy of the model was 92%. The final test accuracy and confusion matrix are in the repository as well. The final notebook is in the repository. Thank you!
